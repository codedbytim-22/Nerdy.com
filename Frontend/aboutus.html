        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Nerdy.com was created for the curious mind — the kind of person who loves diving
            into random facts at 2AM, exploring ancient mysteries, questioning history,
            decoding technology, and learning something new every single day. Here, knowledge
            meets entertainment.
        </p>

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>
            We collect, organize, and present mind‑blowing content from different corners of
            the universe. From science and psychology to conspiracy theories and unsolved
            crimes — Nerdy.com is your digital hub of fascinating information.
        </p>

        <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
        <p>
            Because learning doesn’t have to be boring. We believe information should be
            exciting, engaging, and addictive — something that pulls you into a rabbit hole
            and leaves you smarter than you were five minutes ago.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            To become Africa’s biggest online curiosity platform — a place where young people
            can learn, explore, question, and expand their world.
        </p>

        <h2>Stay Curious</h2>
        <p>
            Nerdy.com isn’t just a website — it’s a mindset. A lifestyle. A community of
            thinkers, learners, and explorers.
